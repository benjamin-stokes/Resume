\headedsubsection
{Postdoctoral Research Associate}
{May '10 -- present}
{\bodytext{I am a research collaborator with the
    \href{http://www.telescopearray.org}{Telescope Array} (\acr{TA})
    cosmic ray observatory. As a one-of-a-kind facility, the 150
    scientists and technologists in the \acr{TA} collaboration are
    responsible for design and maintenance of remote facilities (in
    Millard County, Utah), data acquisition, data storage, data
    analysis and public dissemination of resulting scientific
    knowledge.  This mission has required the \acr{TA} collaboration
    to develop extensive computational resources and has resulted in
    groundbreaking discoveries about the origin and composition of
    cosmic rays. My principal achievements include:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf {Developing a
          \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4643}{technique} for mapping
          and reducing parallel computations.}} I pursued this effort
      with the aim of open-ended scalability and robust fault
      protection. The resulting software could be described as a
      highly specialized reinvention of MapReduce implemented on Linux
      clusters with bash scripting employing a high degree of
      concurrency.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Designing the primary framework for the
          Monte Carlo simulation of the \acr{TA} observatory.}}  This
      effort entailed integrating 40 years worth of legacy code
      (\acr{FORTRAN} and \acr{C}), writing 20,000 lines of new code
      (\acr{C}, \acr{C++} and No\acr{SQL}), and innovating an entirely
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3182}{novel algorithmic
        approach}.  The
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0644}{resulting simulations} are
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5067}{unprecedented} in detail
      and accuracy.
   \item \textit{\textbf{Engaging in big data management.}}  In
     addition to the two Linux clusters described below, I built and
     manage a 50~TB Linux data server and manage a 10~TB remote data
     space. The simulation framework described above is capable of
     producing 500~GB per day.  In order to effectively utilize this
     data, I have developed a keen sense of foresight towards data
     logistics.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Becoming a master troubleshooter.}}  The
      \acr{TA} observatory is operational 24 hours per day, 365 days
      per year.  With operational costs and capital outlays exceeding
      \$100,000 per month, it is imperative that any problems be
      addressed promptly. As a mid-level collaboration member, I have
      developed the skills to rapidly troubleshoot a broad array of
      hardware and software problems.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Engaging in international collaboration.}}
      The \acr{TA} collaboration is 70\% Japanese and, in addition to
      the University of Utah, also has member institutions in South
      Korea, Belgium, and Russia.  Working in this diverse setting has
      taught me to value, above all else, clear communication while
      respecting the cultural differences and sensitivities of those
      around me.

{Postdoctoral Associate}
{Jul '08 -- Apr '10}
{\bodytext{I first joined the \acr{TA} collaboration as a researcher
    with the affiliated group at Rutgers University.  While my
    position was officially in New Jersey, I spent most of my time on
    remote deployment in Utah. In addition to commencing the projects
    described in the previous section, relevant experience included:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf{Building and administering two 20-node
          \href{http://www.rocksclusters.org}{Rocks} Linux clusters.}}
      This proved to be an important test bed for later distributed
      computing  initiatives.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Learning to work remotely.}}  Spending the
      majority of my time 3000~km from the rest of my research group
      was an excellent opportunity to develop independence, clear
      communication, and self-motivation.

    \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512265}{ANITA} and
    \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2589}{AMBER} collaborations.
    Major activities included:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf{Designing and debugging embedded systems.}}
      I developed both embedded software (Linux and \acr{C}) and
      firmware (Xilinx).
    \item \textit{\textbf{Designing and running Monte Carlo
          simulations.}} I designed simulations both by writing new

      observation scenarios.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf{Successfully executing a major domain
          change.}} In making the transition to neuroscience, I
      quickly learned a whole new nomenclature and worldview. In doing
      so, I developed extensive strategies for efficiently tackling
      unfamiliar problems.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Contributing to enterprise software
          development.}} After attending a two-week training course in
      North Carolina, I participated in development of the operational
      source code (\acr{C++}) of Siemens \acr{MRI} scanners.
