{Director of Data Science}
{July 2018 -- Current}
{\bodytext{Sorenson Communications is the premier provider of video
    relay \acr{ASL} interpretation services for the deaf and hard of
    hearing communities in the United States.  As the Director of
    Data Science, I have spearheaded initiatives to introduce machine
    learning into several key junctures of the company's business
    logic:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf {Upgrading the employee scheduling system.}}
    Providing professional interpreting services with 24/7 on-demand
    availability and minimal down-time has always been an
    extraordinary challenge for Sorenson.  By replacing specific
    business knowledge with machine learning algorithms, my team is
    creating a much more resilient system that significantly improves
    efficiency today while adapting to whatever
    new challenges lay ahead.

    \item \textit{\textbf{Using predictive analytics to augment customer
          outreach.}} In order to retain its dominant market share,
      Sorenson must anticipate the needs of its customers. By
      analyzing customer behavior history, my team is utilizing
      machine learning to successfully map and predict important changes in
      customer behavior.

    \item \textit{\textbf {Overseeing the development and
          implementation of an \acr{AI}-driven
          customer engagement platform.}} In
      preliminary tests, this platform was able to increase message
      read rates by 27\% which brought about a substantial increase in
      customer engagement.

   \item \textit{\textbf {Devising a full-stack validation for a
          performance marketing optimization platform.}}
      Through our efforts, the platform
      went from having a negative impact to achieving increases of up
      to 300\% in \acr{ROI} for individual Adwords campaigns.

    \item \textit{\textbf {Architecting, building, and
          operationalizing an AI-driven customer behavior detection
          framework.}}  By harnessing \acr{AI}
      and innovating a method of boot-strapping ever-larger training

      that could spot complex behavioral
      changes with a 99\% accuracy and no
      documented cases of false-positives.

{Research Faculty}
{May 2010 -- March 2016}
{\bodytext{I was a research collaborator with the
    \href{http://www.telescopearray.org}{Telescope Array} (\acr{TA})
    cosmic ray observatory.  The \acr{TA} collaboration
    developed extensive computational resources resulting in
    groundbreaking discoveries about the origin and composition of
    cosmic rays. My principal achievements included:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf{Engaging in international collaboration.}}
      The \acr{TA} collaboration is 85\% international with
      member institutions in Japan,
      Korea, Belgium, and Russia.  Working in this diverse setting
      taught me to value, above all else, clear communication while
      respecting the cultural differences and sensitivities of those
      around me.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Designing the primary framework for the
          Monte Carlo simulation of the \acr{TA} observatory.}}  In
      addition to supervising the integration of simulations provided
      by three independent research groups, my personal effort
      entailed integrating 40 years worth of legacy code,
      writing 20,000 lines of new code, and innovating an entirely
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3182}{novel algorithmic
        approach}.  The
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0644}{resulting simulations} were
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5067}{unprecedented} in detail
      and accuracy.
    \item \textit{\textbf {Developing a
          \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4643}{technique} for mapping
          and reducing parallel computations.}} I pursued this effort
      with the aim of open-ended scalability and robust fault
      protection. The resulting software could be described as a
      highly specialized reinvention of MapReduce implemented on Linux
      clusters with Bash scripting employing a high degree of
      concurrency.
   \item \textit{\textbf{Engaging in big data management.}} I built and
     managed a 50~TB Linux data server and managed a 10~TB remote data
     space. In order to
     effectively utilize this data, I developed a keen sense of
     foresight towards data logistics.
