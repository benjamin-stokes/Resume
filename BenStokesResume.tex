{\bodytext{nThrive provides end-to-end revenue cycle management for the 
	full spectum of healthcare providers.  As the Director of Data Science,
	I lead a team of data scientists, data engineers, and product analysts
	devoted to introducing machine learning into our product lines both through 
	product enhancements and new product offerings.  Key initiatives have 
	included:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf {Introducing ML-asssisted prioritization into work
	item queues.}}  Revenue cycle management often encounters instances where 
	workload exceeds the available resources.  By introducing machine learning
	into the prioritization process we have been able to reduce worker effort
	by up to 40\%
    
	\item \textit{\textbf {Utilizing machine learning to improve cash-flow 
	projections.}}  During the Covid pandemic, our clients have often struggled
	to make accurate projections of expected insurance payments. By introducing 
	predictive analytics into the payment projection process, we have been able
	to create an adaptive solution that achieves a 10x reduction in aggregate error.

    \item \textit{\textbf{Engaging in AI evangelism both within the company and our
	  client base.}} Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is still regarded
	  as mysterious within the larger business community.  Through speaking engagements
	  and roundtables, I have endeavored to render this exciting topic more approachable.

    \item \textit{\textbf {Upgrading the employee scheduling system.}}
    Providing professional interpreting services with 24/7 on-demand
    availability and minimal down-time has always been an
    extraordinary challenge for Sorenson.  By replacing specific
    business knowledge with machine learning algorithms, my team 
    created a much more adaptively resilient system that significantly improved
    efficiency while dictating over \$100 million in cost outlays.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Using predictive analytics to augment customer
          outreach.}} In order to retain its dominant market share,
      Sorenson must anticipate the needs of its customers. By
      analyzing customer behavior history, my team utilized

{\bodytext{I was a research collaborator with the

    developed extensive computational resources resulting in
    groundbreaking discoveries about the origin and composition of
    cosmic rays. In addition to supervising gradutate and undergraduate 
	researchers, my personal achievements included:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf{Designing the primary framework for the
          Monte Carlo simulation of the \acr{TA} observatory.}}  I
      oversaw the integration of simulations provided
      by three independent research groups, and personally integrated 
	  40 years worth of legacy code,
      wrote 20,000 lines of new code, and innovated an entirely
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3182}{novel algorithmic
        approach}.  The
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0644}{resulting simulations} were
      \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5067}{unprecedented} in detail
      and accuracy.
    \item \textit{\textbf {Developing a
          \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4643}{technique} for mapping
          and reducing parallel computations.}} I pursued this effort
      with the aim of open-ended scalability and robust fault
      protection. The resulting software could be described as a
      highly specialized reinvention of MapReduce implemented on Linux
      clusters with Bash scripting employing a high degree of
      concurrency.
   \item \textit{\textbf{Engaging in international collaboration.}}
      The \acr{TA} collaboration is 85\% international with
      member institutions in Japan,
      Korea, Belgium, and Russia.  Working in this diverse setting
      taught me to value, above all else, clear communication while
      respecting the cultural differences and sensitivities of those
      around me.
